# Code-Quiz

## Description
The **Code Quiz** project is the third homework assignment of the March 2021 cohort from University of New Hampshire's full-stack coding bootcamp. 

Allowing us to use the skills covered in this week's course, this project was created to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

This project also includes Bootstrap, uses of local storage, and CSS animation. 

## User Story
 - AS A coding boot camp student
 - I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
 - SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
