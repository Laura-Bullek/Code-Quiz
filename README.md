# Code-Quiz

# Description
The **Password Generator** project is the third homework assignment of the March 2021 cohort from University of New Hampshire's full-stack coding bootcamp. 

This project required us to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that we write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story
 - AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
 - I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
 - SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
